# Building Energy Rating (BER) Maps

## Estimated Small Area BER Breakdown

> Created for the entire Dublin residential building stock as of the [2016 Census](https://www.cso.ie/en/census/census2016reports/census2016smallareapopulationstatistics/) by estimating BER bands from building ages (see [distribution](BER-Age-Profiles.md#estimated-bands))

> **Includes currently geo-coded dwellings that have had a BER completed** ➡ see [SEAI Map](https://www.seai.ie/technologies/seai-maps/ber-map/) for more information. 

> Last update: 07/2020 ➡ represents ~281,000 out of ~465,000<sup>[1](#total-buildings)</sup> Dublin buildings.
