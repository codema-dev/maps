This Heat Demand Density (HDD) estimate is a sum of estimated Residential, Industrial & Non-Industrial building heat demands.  A HDD of greater than 150 TJ/kmÂ² indicates that the region may be suitable for District Heating. 

Residential estimate
= Number of dwellings (from 2016 Census) 
* Average Residential heat demand average
* Average Boiler efficiency

Non-Residential estimate
= Total building floor area (from 08/03/2021 Valuation Office Data)
* Building floor area benchmark (fossil fuel demand per unit floor area) corresponding to the building in question
* Average Boiler efficiency

Average Residential Heat Demand
= roughly 10,000 kWh/year (from 2019 Gas Networks Ireland Annual Gas Consumption)
* 85% efficiency (from BER Public search)
