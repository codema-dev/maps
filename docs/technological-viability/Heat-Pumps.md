This map shows the percentage of heat pump ready homes<sup>1</sup> in each Dublin Small Area<sup>2</sup>.  The map is based on closed-access Building Energy Rating (BER) data provided to Codema - Dublin's Energy Agency on 07/2020.  

> Caveats:

> - Any buildings not in the BER dataset are assumed not to be heat pump ready as any building built prior to 2000 (the bulk of the stock) is currently likely C rated or lower and so unlikely to be up to standard without some retrofitting work.

<sup>1</sup> [SEAI advise](https://www.seai.ie/publications/Technical_Advisor_Role.pdf) that a building with a Heat Loss Parameter (HLP) of less than 2.3 is heat pump ready.

<sup>2</sup> Small Areas are areas of population generally comprising between 80 and 120 dwellings created by The National Institute of Regional and Spatial Analysis (NIRSA) on behalf of the Ordnance Survey Ireland (OSi) in consultation with CSO. Small Areas were designed as the lowest level of geography for the compilation of statistics in line with data protection and generally comprise either complete or part of townlands or neighbourhoods.
