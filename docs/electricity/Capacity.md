# Capacity

## Zonal Substation Capacity

The zones in this map were created by grouping similarly located substations and linking these groups to Small Areas [in this repository](https://github.com/codema-dev/dublin-electricity-network) using data from the [ESB Substation Capacity map](https://www.esbnetworks.ie/network-capacity-map)

> **Caveat:** the ESB substation capacities do not included contracted or bid capacity and so the indicative capacities systematically underestimate availability.  If these were included all zones other than Dun Laoghaire Rathdown would likely be close to zero.
