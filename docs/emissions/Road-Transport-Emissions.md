**Annual Road Transport Carbon Emissions tCO2/yr (NTA)**

> The map of Carbon Emissions is based on a Road Transport Model provided provided to `Codema - Dublin's Energy Agency` by the `National Transport Authority of Ireland (NTA)`. For illustrative purposes, values have been split into eight seperate equal portions, as per their carbon emissions, and a colour has been assigned to them accordingly. Individual road emisisons can be obtained by hovering over a specific location.
