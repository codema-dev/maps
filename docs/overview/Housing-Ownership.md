**Housing Ownership Percentage by Small Area as of the 2016 Census**

> The map of Housing Percentage Ownership is based on the open-access Small-Area Population Statistics (SAPS) 2016, provided provided to `Codema - Dublin's Energy Agency` by the `Central Statistics Office (CSO)`. 

> The definition of the word `owned` in this context refers to two seperate columns from the SAPS. These are `T6_3_OMLH":"Owned with mortgage or loan"` & `"T6_3_OOH":"Owned outright"`, from which they are summed and a percentage is calculated against the column `"T6_3_TH":"Total"`.
